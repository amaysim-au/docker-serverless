## Docker image

The Docker image has the following:

- Node LTS (12.14.0) Alpine: we leverage Babel to be compatible with AWS Lambda runtime
- [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/)
- [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
- zip: handy to zip your own serverless artifact
- [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli): required by some Serverless plug-ins to work
